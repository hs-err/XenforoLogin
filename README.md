## What is this?

A new generation of Minecraft authenticate plugin.

## What can this do?

- Offer extra protection for your online Minecraft server。
- Protect your offline server。
- Through the back-end system(Xenforo，Discuz, etc.) to realize the "invitation code" function。
- Prevent player to do anything before they login.
- Synchronize game accounts and forum accounts.

## Advantages

- Adaptive rate limiting(Intelligent leaky bucket algorithm).
- Country Limitation(Using GeoIP).
- Input password directly into your chat textbox without command.
- Completely asynchronous Network/File IO request after load complete.
- FastLogin support(Pull request opened but not merged yet).
- Automate login support(Using session).
- External login support(Experimental).
- Hide almost all player status before login。
    - Location.
    - Inventory.
    - Gamemode.
    - Health.
    - Food(Including foodLevel, exhaustion and saturation).
    - Oxygen left.
    - Potion effect.
- Resume almost all player status after Login。
    - Location.
    - Gamemode.
    - Health.
    - Falling distance.
    - Velocity.
    - Food(Including foodLevel, exhaustion and saturation).
    - Oxygen left.
    - Potion effect.
- Various back-end system support.
    - Xenforo.
    - UCenter(Discuz).
    - MySQL.
    - SQLite.
    - Customized RestAPI.
- Various password handle support.
- Various platform support.
    - Bukkit.
        - Paper(Competely).
        - Mohist(Partly).
        - Spigot(Partly)
        - CraftBukkit(Partly).
    - Sponge(Partly).
    - Fabric(Experimental).

## Disadventages

- Cant retrieve password by e-mail.
- External login doesnt support skins。
- Session is not cached, resulting in poor performance.
- Stored some player status, may resulting these action **not exist any longer**, make players uncomfortable:
    - Quit server before landing from high area，re-login with no damage.
    - Quit server while no oxygen left, recovering oxygen before login.
    - Quit server because of getting debuff(Such as hungry, poison, etc.), not login until the debuff was over, not
      affected by the debuff.
    - Quit server while gliding with elytra, re-login to get slow down.

## Why not fix the disadvantages

- Some of back-end systems dont have API to change password.
- The work is too difficult, but it will be solved later.
- For Crossing server!
- Server owners are recommended withstand the pressure of players to retain this feature

| Plain      | None |
| MD5        | Very Low |
| MD5Salt    | Common, Easy to migrate to the applications which need to support older versions like Discuz |
